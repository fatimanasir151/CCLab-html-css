  <p>The following sketch consists of combinations of generative motions that were incorporated into it by the help of
    various mathematical functions, including Sin and Cos. Due to adding elements of randomness, each time the sketch
    runs, it portrays certain varieties of motion as well as a continuous rhythm that is clearly visible. I have
    attempted to turn it into a GIF using a template my professor had given to me in order to make the process easier.
